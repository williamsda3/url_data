_Editor’s note: Americans may not see eye to eye on many things, but fully 96 percent of us agree on the importance of Social Security. And no wonder: The program, now nearly 90 years old, has become the bedrock of our retirement finances. Which begs the question: Why are its finances not more secure? To answer that, AARP talked with dozens of experts about Social Security and its future viability. Here’s what we learned._

For decades, financial advisers have used the metaphor of a three-legged stool to describe America’s retirement system: that the equation for late-life security is having a healthy pension from work, ample personal savings and a monthly Social Security payment.

So much for that. Pensions that guarantee income for life are a dying breed in America, and too few Americans have accumulated a nest egg that can provide substantial monthly income across the full expanse of their retirement years. Today, only about 7 percent of older Americans have steady income from all three legs of the stool, the National Institute on Retirement Security reports.

Of those income streams, only Social Security has proven steadfast and strong. Not only is it the largest source of income for most retirees, but it also has never missed a monthly payment since it [cut its first check](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2020/social-security-history-timeline.html "timeline of social security") to Ida May Fuller in 1940. Which is perhaps why so many Americans are anxious about its health. A [2024 AARP poll](https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/work-finances-retirement/social-security/social-security-medicare-public-opinions/ "poll shows social security concerns") found that 75 percent of Americans age 50 and older are concerned that Social Security won’t be there when they need it.

“Those who tend to distrust the government seem to have less faith that Social Security will be there for them in its current form,” said Michael Baughman, a financial planner in Tryon, North Carolina. “And as you work with younger clients, there is even less confidence in Social Security.”

While worry about the program is hardly new, the skeptics do have a point. Social Security’s finances are unquestionably on shaky ground, with the program annually paying out more in benefits than it collects in revenue. Stabilizing them is primarily in the hands of the U.S. Congress. If no action is taken, the moment of crisis — when the program would no longer have enough money to fully pay its promised benefits — will arrive in just over a decade.

Although there’s plenty of reason to suspect that Congress will drag its feet, it is likely that pressure will build to act before that moment. But it could be awfully close to the deadline.

“Any reform that’s politically feasible requires things that both parties hate,” says Reid Ribble, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin’s 8th District. “Republicans have never wanted to increase revenue, and just dealing with it on the benefit side is not politically feasible.”

### Popular and troubled

Social Security is one of the most successful anti-poverty programs this country has ever created. Without Social Security benefits, 22.7 million more Americans would be below the poverty line, 16.5 million of them 65 or older, according to a [January 2024 analysis](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-lifts-more-people-above-the-poverty-line-than-any-other "social security prevents poverty") by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Social Security does more than send eligible retirees a payment every month. It provides ongoing income to surviving spouses and their children as well. [Social Security Disability Insurance](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/apply-for-ss-disability/ "ssdi provides financial assistance") (SSDI) helps people pay the bills when they are unable to work due to a [serious illness or injury](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/medical-conditions/ "medical conditions that ssdi covers"). Among those whom Social Security keeps out of poverty, 6.2 million are under age 65, including nearly 870,000 children.

Not surprisingly, Social Security has widespread support. “It’s crystal clear that Americans of all generations value the economic stability Social Security has offered" since 1935, says Nancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer.

But there’s trouble on the horizon. Absent any change in law, the [Social Security trust funds](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/how-is-social-security-funded/ "funding is running low") — the financial accounts that the program draws from when annual payments to Americans are larger than annual tax collections — will be out of money in 11 years, according to the [latest annual report](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2024/social-security-trust-fund-shortfall.html "reports show how long benefits will last") from Social Security’s trustees. At that point, the program would have only ongoing tax revenue with which to fund payments; the Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that would cover only 83 percent of promised benefits.

To Congress, 2035 is a long way off. But the sooner the legislature acts, the quicker and easier it will be to bolster the trust funds’ reserves, due to simple math: Smaller revenue or benefit changes made now would accrue over time, which is a far more efficient way to secure the funds than paying for a last-minute major repair job.

### How we got here

One reason Americans get angry at talk of lower Social Security payments is that most of us have been paying into the system ever since our first jobs. And it’s not a trivial amount: Fully 12.4 percent of your gross income has gone to Social Security each paycheck by way of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) payroll tax.

If you work for someone else, it’s split evenly: You pay 6.2 percent of your income, and your employer chips in the other 6.2 percent. The self-employed [pay the full freight](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/self-employed-social-security-medicare-taxes/ "how social security and medicare interact"). The amount of wages subject to the payroll tax is capped and adjusted annually for national wage trends. In 2024, a worker pays the tax on wages up to $168,600. For a self-employed worker clearing that amount or more, that means an annual OASDI tax bill of $20,906.

After the Social Security Administration pays beneficiaries, any tax dollars that are left over go into the trust funds, to be tapped when taxes coming into the system aren’t enough to cover ongoing benefit payments.

![Image 283: spinner image](https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg)    ![Image 284: hand holds vintage photograph of a birthday boy with pile of old photos and a social security card in background](https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarpe/en/home/retirement/social-security/info-2022/benefits-current-status-future-stability/_jcr_content/root/container_main/container_body_main/container_body2/container_body_cf/body_two_cf_one/par4/body_one_callout_one/cfimage.coreimg.50.932.jpeg/content/dam/aarp/retirement/social-security/2020/11/1140-baby-boomer-birthday.jpg)

That time is now. With expenses outstripping revenue, the SSA has begun drawing on the trust funds to fully cover benefit payments. Absent any major changes, the funds — which peaked at about $2.91 trillion in 2021 — will run dry in 2035, according to the agency’s latest projections. That’s 23 years earlier than the SSA estimated when the system was last overhauled in 1983.

How did we get here? Demographics explain a good deal: By the end of the decade, the entirety of the boomer generation — some 70 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 — will have [reached the traditional retirement age](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/planning-for-retirement/info-2023/silver-tsunami-late-boomers-turn-65.html "when you should retire") of 65. By 2030, the SSA estimates, nearly 70.5 million people will be collecting Social Security, nearly double the total in 1980.

That growth was long predicted. What wasn’t known as accurately was how much longer those boomers would live. “From 1940 to 2019, [life expectancies](https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2024/longevity-lifestyles.html "life expectancy has risen") at age 65 have increased by about 6.5 years,” says Amy Kemp, chair of the Social Security Committee of the American Academy of Actuaries.

The impact: Many workers will be receiving benefits for a longer period. And those with higher incomes, who are generally those who receive higher benefit amounts, tend to live longer on average.

At the same time, there has been a continued decline in the nation’s birth rate; that means fewer younger workers to support the benefits promised to older workers. In 1955, there were more than eight workers supporting each Social Security beneficiary. Now there are 2.8 workers per beneficiary, and in 2035, the SSA projects, there will be 2.3.

Additionally, the country’s growing income inequality has had a negative effect on the amount of payroll taxes going into the trust funds, as wages above the payroll tax cap have grown much faster than wages under the cap.

All this doesn’t mean that the Social Security program will end in 2035.

“People could be erroneously thinking that all benefits will be cut off at that point,” Kemp says. “But once the reserve is depleted, benefits will still be payable," though only about 83 percent will be covered by the payroll taxes coming into the system. Even if nothing is done, Social Security is projected to still be able to pay roughly three-quarters of promised benefits for the remainder of the century.

Still, the springtime release of an annual report from the trustees who oversee the Social Security trust funds typically causes a flurry of foreboding news coverage, and survey after survey shows that Americans are doubtful about the program’s future, particularly younger generations. In a [2023 poll by the Nationwide Retirement Institute](https://www.nrsforu.com/rsc-web-preauth/plansponsor/news/articles/adults-believe-social-security-benefits-will-dry-up "generational views on social security viability"), 45 percent of Generation Z respondents and 39 percent of millennials said they do not expect to get a dime from Social Security, compared to 25 percent of Gen Xers and 10 percent of boomers.

Adults born after 1981 “are more likely to assume future benefits will be nonexistent, while families who are five to 10 years from claiming Social Security assume benefits will be reduced or means-tested,” notes Cody Garrett, a financial planner in Pearland, Texas.

### Difficult choices

So what needs to happen to secure Social Security for the long term? Some variables are out of the direct control of the SSA or Congress, such as the economy, wages, life expectancy and birth rates. But if projections hold more or less true, on paper the options are fairly simple: Congress will have to raise taxes, modify benefits or do some of both. Those options come down to any variation of a handful of leading approaches discussed by policymakers. Here are several, starting with ways to bring more money into the system.

*   **Adjust the cap.** This year, someone with $1 million in work income would pay the same amount of OASDI tax as someone with $168,600 in wages. Eliminating the taxable wage cap would keep the trust funds solvent until 2060, according to Social Security. Other, less drastic approaches could be simply raising the cap to a higher level or creating a payroll tax “doughnut hole,” with income between the current cap and a second, higher threshold (say, $400,000) not subject to the payroll tax.
*   **Increase payroll tax rates.** As noted, the current rate is 12.4 percent. Some propose raising that incrementally — to, say, 14.4 percent — as a way to bring additional dollars into the trust funds. But some experts note that such tax increases would be hardest felt by those who earn lower wages or are self-employed.
*   **Broaden the base.** Not all state and local employees are covered by Social Security; some have only public pension coverage. Bringing all newly hired state and local workers into the Social Security system and taxing their wages accordingly would create a large influx of cash, although it would mean more beneficiaries to pay later. But this isn’t a simple solution either, as it could pose challenges to pension plans operated on behalf of local governments.
*   **Broaden the definition of income.** Certain forms of workplace remuneration, such as the value of employer-sponsored group health insurance or contributions to a flexible spending account, are not subject to SSA payroll taxes. Eliminating these exclusions would increase Social Security’s revenue. However, the SSA projects that this would only extend the trust funds’ solvency by a few years. A significantly larger target, and so more politically challenging, would be to levy a Social Security tax on annual investment income, as opposed to just taxing work-related income.

The other side of the coin is implementing changes that reduce benefits to certain Social Security beneficiaries. Here are several approaches that have been floated.

*   **Introduce more progressivity.** Typically referred to as “means testing,” this approach calls for adjusting the size of your Social Security payments based on your wages, wealth or income. The concept is to protect people below a certain annual income or wage level so they get full benefits; those who are financially healthier would sacrifice some or all of their Social Security payments.
*   **Cut benefits for new recipients.** Another approach would be to pay newly eligible retirees a little less per month than promised. Cutting payments to new retirees by 5 percent, starting in 2025, would extend the life of the trust funds only to 2036, according to a 2023 study by the SSA. If your monthly payment was to be $2,000, a cut of that size would bring it to $1,900.
*   **Reduce the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).** The SSA [annually adjusts benefit payments](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2020/colas-history.html "how colas help beneficiaries") to account for inflation. The yardstick used is the government’s consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, which factors in price increases for everything from apples to gasoline to rent. Proposals have been floated to switch to different inflation measures, or to simply reduce the COLA outright. But doing so would be highly unpopular. Typically, COLAs already come in a bit below the general inflation rate; reducing them would compound the impact of rising prices on beneficiaries over time, without doing much to change the long-term financial health of the program.
*   **Change benefit calculations.** Adjusting the complex formulas used to [determine your Social Security payments](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/social-security-benefits-calculation/ "how benefits are calculated") could result in modestly lower benefits but help increase the life of the trust funds. Here’s an example: The SSA uses your highest 35 years of salary history to determine your retirement benefit. Using a higher number of years, such as 38 or 40, would reduce a beneficiary’s average annual earnings and, as a result, the size of his or her monthly benefit.
*   **Up the retirement age.** You can start taking Social Security, with reduced benefits, at age 62. Wait until [your full retirement age](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/social-security-full-retirement-age/ "when you should retire") (currently between 66 and 67 depending on your year of birth) and you qualify for your full benefit. Gradually increasing one or both thresholds would ease some of the strain on the trust funds. But it would also hurt those retirees who can’t wait longer to get Social Security. “There are a lot of jobs where people’s bodies just wear out,” says Ribble, the former congressman.

![Image 287: spinner image](https://cdn.aarp.net/etc/uxdia/images/uxdia-spinner.svg)    ![Image 288: Protestor at a rally in 2005 against Social Security privatization is dressed in a Social Security card costume.](https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarpe/en/home/retirement/social-security/info-2022/benefits-current-status-future-stability/_jcr_content/root/container_main/container_body_main/container_body3/container_body_cf/body_three_cf_one/par3/articlecontentfragme/cfimage.coreimg.50.932.jpeg/content/dam/aarp/retirement/social-security/2022/02/1140-protestor-social-security-rally-2005.jpg) 

Protestors rallied against the privatization of Social Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, April 26, 2005.

Then there are the more radical ideas. Some have suggested scrapping the entire program and converting it to individual accounts similar to 401(k) plans, in which you contribute some or all of your current payroll taxes to a self-managed retirement account invested in stocks, bonds and other securities; you would bear the risks and rewards of your choices.

President George W. Bush proposed such a plan in 2005, but it was widely rejected by the American public. Experts also note that such a program would mean the trust funds would be depleted sooner, putting current benefits at even greater risk.

### Getting it right

Though many of its provisions provoked vigorous debate, the 1983 legislation negotiated between House Speaker Tip O’Neill and President Ronald Reagan, which has kept the program solvent over the past four decades, ultimately won large bipartisan support.

“The OASI trust fund actually reached the point where technically, it would have become depleted in 1982,” says SSA chief actuary Stephen Goss, referring to the part of Social Security’s coffers that pays out retirement and survivor benefits. (The other part, called the DI fund, pays out disability benefits.) Fortunately, some technical maneuvers allowed full payments to be made until the Social Security Amendments of 1983 were signed into law.

That bill [gradually raised full retirement age](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/is-the-full-retirement-age-going-up/ "the retirement age may be rising") for beneficiaries to 67, [levied taxes on Social Security payments](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2023/social-security-taxes.html "how taxes are collected on social security") for some beneficiaries, and increased the payroll-tax rate, all of which would be difficult to reach consensus on in Congress today.

Legislators in Congress still routinely propose bills to alter Social Security, ranging from small adjustments to substantive overhauls. Dozens of members have introduced such bills in the last few years; to date, none has moved to a full vote.

### Standing on one leg?

Americans rely on it. It’s long been cited that Social Security was meant to provide just 40 percent of your retirement income. But [according to SSA data](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf "social security is being used differently than it was intended"), 12 percent of men and 15 percent of women on Social Security rely on it for 90 percent or more of their income. Even a modest reduction in benefits would hit them hard. And 37 percent of men and 42 percent of women on Social Security get 50 percent or more of their income from the program.

With around 67 million people today receiving benefits, that means tens of millions of Americans depend heavily on the program. And already, their payments aren’t high. The average retirement benefit from Social Security in March 2024 was about $1,913 a month, or just under $23,000 a year. The median rent for an apartment in the U.S. that month was $1,987, according to Rent.com.

“When I did my research on it, probably the hardest-hit recipient of Social Security was a widow who has outlived her family savings and is now living in old age, strictly on Social Security,” Ribble says. “She’s trying to live off a $700- or $800-a-month payment.”

Even though those who rely on Social Security alone are struggling, and the trust funds face depletion, lawmakers haven’t acted — yet. Still, if history is any guide, there’s reason to hope that Congress will find a solution. Says Social Security’s Goss: “We’ve never reached the point where we depleted the reserves and had to reduce benefits.”

### **AARP and Social Security**

For more than 60 years, AARP has fought to protect Americans’ hard-earned Social Security benefits, answer your questions about the program and make sure it continues to be financially strong for future generations. Here’s what those efforts look like today.

**Advocacy in Washington and beyond**

In 2024, AARP will continue to urge members of Congress to shore up Social Security’s long-term finances and keep the promises made to all current and future beneficiaries. We have fought hard against arbitrary cuts to the cost-of-living adjustment and against congressional proposals to [create a fiscal commission](https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/work-finances-retirement/financial-security-retirement/fiscal-commissions-support/ "more needs to be done to protect social security") that could target Social Security as a way to deal with budget deficits. And we fought hard to ensure that those on Social Security would be able to get economic stimulus payments without having to file separately.

Delivering better service: AARP plans to continue highlighting [customer service challenges](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2024/hiring-freeze-customer-service.html "wait times reach record highs for social security calls") and solutions at the Social Security Administration (SSA) and advocating for Congress to approve adequate funding for the SSA to deliver benefits and services properly and promptly to its growing number of customers.

State taxation: [Ten U.S. states](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/which-states-do-not-tax-social-security-benefits/ "states that still tax social security") still tax Social Security benefits. AARP will continue working at the state level to reduce or eliminate this tax burden for more retirees and their families.

**Helping to answer your questions**

AARP’s [Navigating Social Security](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers// "get your questions answered on social security") knowledge base can help you find answers to both basic and complicated questions about Social Security. And the [AARP Social Security Calculator](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/benefits-calculator/ "calculate your benefits") can provide estimates of future benefit payments and information on how to maximize them.

**Online seminars**

AARP offers [free webinars](https://virtualevents.aarp.org/socialsecurity-hub/en/home?cmp=OTH-CSN-LEARN-MULTI-SOCSEC "aarp webinars on social security") to help Americans 50 and older make informed decisions about Social Security. Consumers also can watch past webinars related to financial planning, Medicare and fraud and get help from retirement experts.
