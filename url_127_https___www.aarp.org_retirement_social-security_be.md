<p\>From age 62, your monthly benefit amount will increase each month you hold off collecting until you reach age 70. You receive your maximum Social Security retirement benefit if you wait until age 70 to claim.</p\>

<p\>Below is the estimated retirement benefit for your spouse, based on the age and income information you entered.

<p\>You may be eligible to receive benefits based on your former spouse’s earnings history. If you are at least 62 years old, were married to your former spouse for at least 10 years and have not remarried, you could receive divorced-spouse benefits worth up to 50 percent of your ex-spouse’s Social Security payment, if that would be higher than your own retirement benefit. </p\> <p\> </p\> <p\><a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/aarpe/en/home/playground-for-testing-stuff/margaretc-training-bucket/version-two-ss-calculator.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

### What does AARP’s Social Security Calculator do?

Members only

                     

The calculator provides an estimate of your monthly Social Security retirement benefit, based on your earnings history and age. Our tool also helps you see what percentage of daily expenses your benefits can cover and how you can increase your monthly payment by waiting to collect. It can also tell you how your Social Security income could be affected if you [keep working after you claim your benefit](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/social-security-payment-increase-working/ "claim and keeping working").

### How does the calculator estimate my retirement benefit?  

Our simplified estimate is based on two main data points: your age and your average earnings.

Your monthly retirement benefit depends on how much you’ve earned over your lifetime at jobs (including self-employment) for which you paid Social Security taxes. The Social Security Administration (SSA) includes your 35 highest-earning years, adjusted for historical wage growth, in its benefit calculation. You can review your earnings history by creating an online [My Social Security account](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ "my social security account").

Your Social Security benefit also depends on how old you are when you begin receiving it. You can [start collecting at the minimum retirement age of 62](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/eligible-for-social-security/ "start collecting social security"), but you’ll get a bigger monthly payment if you [wait until full retirement age](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/social-security-full-retirement-age/ "full retirement age"), which is between 66 and 67, depending on your year of birth. (It will settle at 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If you can wait until 70 to start collecting, you’ll receive your maximum monthly benefit.

Social Security FAQs

Open All

### Could marital status affect my benefits?

Marital status does not affect the retirement benefit you’re eligible to get based on your earnings record, but it can affect what other benefits you might qualify for.

For example, [if you were divorced](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/ex-spouse-social-security/ "ex-spouse social security") after at least 10 years of marriage, you may be able to receive [divorced-spouse benefits](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/info-2016/divorced-social-security-benefits.html "divorced spouse benefit") based on your ex-spouse’s earnings history. If you’re widowed, you may be entitled to survivor benefits. In most cases, you’re eligible for these if you’re at least 60 years old and were married at least nine months before your spouse died.

Our calculator does not calculate spouse, divorced-spouse or survivor benefits. For these scenarios, consult the SSA website.

### Can I qualify for Social Security benefits if I'm also receiving a pension?

In most cases, receiving a pension will not affect your Social Security status. A potential exception is when the pension comes from a workplace where you did not pay Social Security taxes (as is the case for some state and local government agencies). If you are receiving such a pension and also collect Social Security based on other employment, your benefit payment could be reduced.

### Who is eligible to collect Social Security retirement benefits?

Workers who are at least age 62 and who have worked at least 10 combined years at jobs for which they paid Social Security taxes are eligible for Social Security retirement benefits.

In many cases, spouses, widows and widowers, and divorced people are eligible for benefits based on a current or former spouse’s earnings history. Unmarried children 18 and younger (or older, in some cases, if they have a disability or are still attending secondary school) can also get benefits based on a retired or deceased parent’s earnings record.

### How is Social Security funded?

Primarily through payroll taxes. The current tax rate for Social Security is 12.4 percent of gross income. For most workers, that’s split between employer and employee — 6.2 percent each. If you’re self-employed, you pay the entire amount. The government collects [Social Security tax on wages](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/maxtax.html "how social security is taxed") up to $176,100 in 2025.

### When should I start collecting Social Security?

That’s a question only you can answer. Financial advisers generally recommend starting as late as you can, because the longer you wait, the bigger your monthly payment. But the right time for you may depend on other factors, such as your health, marital status, spending habits and how much you have saved for retirement.

Keep in mind that Social Security was never intended to be the sole source of income for retirees. Traditionally, the retirement system in the U.S. has been a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions and savings. However, employers, especially in the private sector, have moved away from pension plans in favor of tax-deferred retirement savings accounts such as 401(k) plans, increasing the importance of individual savings as a source of later-in-life income to complement Social Security.

### Can I use the calculator to figure out Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments?

No. The calculator only estimates retirement benefits.

SSDI is designed for people who can’t do most work because they have a severe medical condition — one expected to last at least a year or result in death. Your [SSDI benefits](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/disability-benefits/ "ssdi benefits") last only as long as you are prevented from earning a living due to a medical impairment.

[SSI](https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/ssi-eligible/ "ssi eligible") is a separate benefit program for people with little or no income or assets who are 65 or older, blind or have disabilities. The maximum monthly federal SSI payment for 2025 is $967 for a single person and $1,450 for a married couple in which both spouses qualify for the program (some states add to that), but you may receive less than the maximum if you or your family has other income.
